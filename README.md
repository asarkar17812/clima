CiviL Infrastructure research for climate change Mitigation and Adaptation (CLIMA) is a research effort focused on infrastructure research to help develop equitable and feasible solutions to the increasingly urgent threats posted by climate change through mitigating damages and adapting to hazards and changes across coastal communities. 

This leg of CLIMA is an interdisciplinary research project aims to model the effects of flood risk on coastal communities through a detailed
investigation of the social networks, as well as other factors, in an attempt to create models that are more capable of capturing human mobility phenomena, especially amongst homeowners. By using a modified compartmental model, we can split the population into unique sets and utilize the mean-field hypothesis to treat individuals as identical, thus allowing us focus on the population's dynamics instead of individual-level cognition. To better appreciate the unique perspectives of individuals and communities that face these threats, CLIMA also seeks to include qualitative information about the network extracted through interviews with homeowners of coastal communities here, in NYC. Furthermore, demographic breakdowns of the locations of study were done to further understand the context and the actual lives of the homeowners within these communities. On the quantitative side, we utilize more traditional methods, including the utilization of historical Census data and related public data to build a more comprehensive profile of demographics.

This notebook specifically focuses on the scaling of social connections with population in counties and CBSAs, and demographic analyses.
